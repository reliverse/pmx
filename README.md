# @reliverse/pmx

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reliverse/pmx) | [GitHub](https://github.com/reliverse/pmx)

A versatile package manager that wraps around [bun](https://bun.sh), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager). This [global installation](https://lewistech.medium.com/understanding-local-and-global-npm-packages-47d547a00147) tool detects your preferred package manager and installs packages accordingly.

Just switched to `bun` but still type `pnpm` out of habit, messing up your node_modules? `pmx` reduces the chances of such errors and improves your workflow!

## Installation

```bash
bun i -g @reliverse/pmx # instead of bun you can use: npm, pnpm, or yarn (deno support is coming soon)
```
